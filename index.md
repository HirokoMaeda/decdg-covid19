## Datasets from the World Bank ##

**[COVID-19 Related Datasets][ddh]**.
This collection in the World Bank data catalog contains datasets that may be useful for analysis or modelling.
It was developed by searching for health-related keywords such as "doctors," "hospitals," "respirators," etc.
Some datasets may therefore not be relevant to the current pandemic. This will be expanded and improved over time.
